These scripts are designed to set up a system manually by someone who already understands them and can make many small edits to make them work on a particular system of interest. Consequently, they may not be useful for other users to use without extensive study of the code. Briefly, to use them you will need to edit the .sh scripts to point at appropriately installed versions of CHARMM and ALF on your cluster, you will need to make appropriate changes to util/ConvPDB.py to make it read and format the various chains of the PDB correctly, you will need to edit 1Setup.inp and 3Setup.inp to include appropriate segids for the various protein chains and patches for protonation state changes and disulfide bonds. Histidine protonation states are set with FixHis.sh. 2Solvate.sh will need to be edited to set the box size and salt concentration. The system setup will end up in scratch3 or prep.
