This example illustrates the setup of mutations to T16 in protein G (pbd code 1pga). Before one can set up the MSLD calculation, one must set up the MD calculation without mutations first.

The setup of the MD calculation is demonstrated in two ways, first in mdsetup a collection of scripts sets up the system. The same system is set up using CHARMM-GUI in the mdcharmmgui directory.

The setup of MSLD is done on the mdsetup result inside msldsetup, and on the CHARMM-GUI result in msldcharmmgui.

The aa_stream directory contains the alchemical information used in the msld setup and calculation, and contains a detailed README on the components and their usage.

The output of system setup is a directory called prep that can be used with pyALF, available for download at www.github.com/ryanleehayes/alf
