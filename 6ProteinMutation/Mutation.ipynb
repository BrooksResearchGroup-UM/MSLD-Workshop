    "The first study amino acid mutations with $\\lambda$ dynamics (in T4 lysozyme) placed the protein backbone in the environment (with a single C$\\alpha$ atom) and used patches for the side chains (which gives many C$\\beta$ atoms). An immediately obvious limitation of this is that glycine and proline mutations cannot be treated with this approach because backbone parameters and connectivity change.\n",

    "This approach works because the alchemical regions are connected to the environment in just one place, via the C$\\alpha$-C$\\beta$ bond, and this allows the contribution of the unscaled bonded interactions to be factored out of the partition function by a change of variables when $\\lambda=0$.

    "An obvious limitation of the side chain perturbation scheme is that backbone parameters and connectivity change for glycine and especially for proline mutations, so they cannot be treated with the side chain perturbation scheme. An obvious alternative is to scale the entire residue by $\\lambda$. However, the alchemical group is now bonded to the rest of the system in two places, and unscaled bonds can no longer be factored out of the partition function when $\\lambda=0$. Consider an example of a problem this causes: in mutating from proline to glycine, when proline is off, the ring topology still restricts rotation around the protein $\\phi$ angle, so glycine loses entropy it ought to have in the unfolded ensemble, and the $\\Delta\\Delta G$ favors glycine more than it should, because the entropic cost of folding glycine is artificially reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to scale the entire residue by $\\lambda$ two additional techniques were developed. The first was a soft bond scaled by $\\lambda$ in the proline side chain. This allows free rotation around the backbone $\\phi$ angle when $\\lambda=0$, and while the whole residue cannot be factored out of the partition function, at least the side chains and HN atoms can be.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second development was to scale all the remaining backbone bonds which could not be factored out of the partition function by $\\lambda$ so they do not contribute to the partition function at $\\lambda=0$, and harmonically restrain these gas phase atoms to an analogous atom on another substituent so they do not drift off. These harmonic restraints can also be factored out of the partition function.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two developments lead to two additional sections in the BLOCK module. The CATS section (Constrained ATom Scaling) lists groups of atoms that are restrained together whose bonded interactions are scaled by $\\lambda$. There must be one atom from each substituent in each CATS selection. The SOBO section (SOft BOnds) list pairs of bonded atoms whose bond term (and associated angle terms) should be scaled by $\\lambda$.\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional complication of this approach is that adjacent mutations must have bonded terms added between mutated forms of the residues, necessitating a more complicated patching procedure. Fortunately, this patching is scripted.\n",
