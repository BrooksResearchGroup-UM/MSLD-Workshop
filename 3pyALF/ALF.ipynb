However, even with poor biases the direction in which to change biases is quite clear from the parts of profiles that are sampled. Thus many cycles of ALF are run. Each cycle consists of molecular dynamics sampling followed by estimation of new bias parameters. Early cycles are very short to avoid wasting computational resources. Simulations get longer as the biases improve."

To deal with this, sampling from the previous 5 cycles is agregated together. This gives a more comprehensive view of the landscape. Including significantly more than the previous 5 cycles was found to cause artifacts because older simulations far from equilibrium were treated on the same footing as more recent simulations with better biases, leading to distorted estimates of the landscape. The previous 5 cycles were all run with different biasing potentials, so they are combined with WHAM/MBAR.
