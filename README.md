# MSLD-Workshop
## Materials for five day workshop on using MSLD (including ALF and MSLD_py_prep) for drug discovery and protein engineering
### List of to dos before making public
- add brief agenda
- describe requirements for participation
- other stuff?

_Note, I have added a file with a template for building a conda environment from which CHARMM/pyCHARMM can be run and a number of other Python packages are included. This can be added to, but should certainly be tested._

_Also, I just added two examples from the pyCHARMM-Workshop github, the basic building of an alanine dipeptide then solvating it, and the set-up of a protein system (w/o paying attention to ionizable groups) and running dynamics with OpenMM or BLaDe. All visualization is now done with nglview._
