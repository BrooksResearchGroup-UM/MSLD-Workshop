# MSLD-Workshop
## Materials for five day workshop on using MSLD (including ALF and MSLD_py_prep) for drug discovery and protein engineering
### General Requirements:
- Most of these scripts will be run using the Slurm Workload Manager.
- We highly encourage you work in a Linux environment, since CUDA is no longer supported using the Apple installation.

- While note explicitly required, please try to have a CHARMM-GUI account, which is free of charge at: charmm-gui.org
