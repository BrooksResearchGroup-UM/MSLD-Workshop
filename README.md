## Materials for five day workshop on using MSLD (including ALF and MSLD_py_prep) for drug discovery and protein engineering
### List of to dos before making public
- get flyer posted within this document
- add brief agenda
- describe requirements for participation
- other stuff?

_Note, I have added a file with a template for building a conda environment from which CHARMM/pyCHARMM can be run and a number of other Python packages are included. This can be added to, but should certainly be tested._
