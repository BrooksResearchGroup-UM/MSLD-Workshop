# Constant pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD)
## Under construction !!!!

### outline:

- (1) The physical principle behind CpHMD (done)
- (2) Set up a CpHMD simulation for model compound: Lys in water (almost done for ALF flattening. More comments are needed to make it clear; also working on the validation)
- (3) Set up a CpHMD simulation for a peptide (upcoming)
- (4) Analyze the simulation results: get titration curve and pKa (upcoming)
- (5) Remarks about advanced techniques (upcoming)
