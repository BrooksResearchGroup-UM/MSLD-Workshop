# Constant pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD)
## Under construction !!!!

### outline:

- (1) The physical principle behind CpHMD (done)
- (2) Set up a CpHMD simulation for model compound: Lys in water (almost done. More comments are needed to make it clear)
- (3) Set up a CpHMD simulation for a peptide (upcoming)
- (4) Remarks about advanced techniques (upcoming)

### File description:
- CpHMD.ipynb: jupyter notebook of this tutorial
- fig: a directory containing figures used in CpHMD.ipynb
- toppar_c36_jul21: force field parameters used for this tutorial
- water-lys: initial structures and input files required for running a simulation of Lys in water
- water-glu: initial structures and input files required for running a simulation of Glu in water
