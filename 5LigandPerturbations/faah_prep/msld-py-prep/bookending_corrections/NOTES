NOTES for the user

This set of scripts are used to run and analyze charge perturbation
simulations needed to get the charge correction from
renormalized to force field charge free energies of binding per
molecule (as specified in the block section of your prep/{sysname}.inp
script. 

*** Copy these scripts into the ALF directory you want to get 
corrections for, then cd into the ALF directory. ***

1. Split the system into the different end states by running:

    `python 1_split_system.py`

    - Change the initial parameters listed after the
    package imports to reflect those of your system.
    - This sets up a physical_ligands directory with
    each block combination and the corresponding system being
    simulated (can be ligand in water, prot, vac depending
    on your {sysname}.inp script specifications)
    - It assigns a ff_charges.txt and crn_charges.txt 
    file that has the necessary CHARMM scalar commands
    to interconvert between the two charge sets. Make
    sure these are different. If they are the same then 
    you don't have to do the correction! (dG=0)

2. Run each MD simulation per ligand (each end state corresponds
    to a particular charge set, either ff or crn) by running:

    `sbatch 2_run_md.sh`

    - This will deploy every pair of MD simulations per ligand/block
    end state. 
    - You can modify the number of equilibration/production steps
    in `charge_correction.py` in lines :198-200. Make sure your
    initial parameters lited after the package imports reflect
    those of your system
    - Once the sims are done, they will output the dcd, res files, 
    as well as {ff/crn}_{e1/e2}.csv corresponding to the charge set
    simulation with the snapshot energies evaluated for both charge sets
    (e1 or e2 specify energy1, or the energy for the charge set that
    was used to run the simulation, and energy2, the energy for
    those same snapshot evaluated using the other charge set)

3. You can get the free energies per molecule by running:
 
    `python 3_get_all_free_energies.py`

    - This creates an overlap.pdf file that shows the potential
    differences between the two simulations run with different
    charge states. It also reports an overlap which should be
    around 85-100% if everything is converged.
    - It also creates a Result.txt file that shows the free
    energy value and its associated uncertainty from bootstrapping.

DEV NOTES
This is how I ran the charge renormalization corrections for MSLD.
Attempted parallelizing with pympi but it seems like there are some
issues with this package if mpi is being used at the Fortran level
based on how pyCHARMM was compiled.
