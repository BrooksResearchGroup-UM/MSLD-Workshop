One way we can approach this (and there are other ways) is to split apart the solvated system pdb file (`step2_solvator.pdb`) that was obtained from the CHARMM-GUI into separate pdb files. For convenience, `step2_solvator.pdb` can be found in `faah_prep/split_complex`. An additional script, `list_segids.py`, is also found in that directory. This script reads an input pdb file and breaks it apart into separate pdb files by segid. (The script assumes it is given a CHARMM-formmatted pdb file). Running this script on `step2_solvator.pdb` will provide us with protein (proa.pdb), water (solv.pdb), and ion (ion.pdb) pdb files.
